# Rest-api-use-dto-concept-in-springboot
Overview
This project is a Product Management REST API built using Spring Boot. It efficiently handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products and implements the Data Transfer Object (DTO) pattern to manage data flow between different layers. This ensures a clean architecture with enhanced performance and security.
Features
DTO Pattern: Keeps internal models hidden and only transfers essential data between the client and server.
CRUD Operations: Manage products via Create, Read, Update, and Delete functions.
Validation: Built-in validation for DTOs to ensure data correctness.
Error Handling: Comprehensive exception handling with informative messages
Project Structure
Entity Layer: Represents the data model (Product entity) mapped to the database.
DTO Layer: Objects (ProductDTO) responsible for transferring data.
Service Layer: Contains business logic and handles interactions between the controller and repository.
Controller Layer: Defines RESTful endpoints to interact with the API.
Repository Layer: Uses JpaRepository to interact with the MySQL database.
Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language.
Spring Boot: Framework for building RESTful services.
MySQL: Relational database for persistent storage.
Spring Data JPA: Simplifies data access and management.
Maven: For dependency management and build automation.
DTO Pattern
The Data Transfer Object (DTO) pattern is used to:

Decouple the data model from the API, ensuring only required fields are exposed.
Simplify complex data structures, reducing the size of API responses and requests.
Enhance security, as internal implementation details remain hidden from the client.

Example: Product Entity and ProductDTO
Product Entity
java
Copy code
@Entity
public class Product {

    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    private String description;
    private double price;

API Endpoints
The following RESTful endpoints are exposed:
Method |	Endpoint	         | Description
GET	   | /api/products/{id}	 | Fetch a product by ID
POST	 | /api/products	     |Create a new product
PUT	   | /api/products/{id}	 | Update an existing product
DELETE |/api/products/{id}	 | Delete a product by ID
Sample Requests
Get Product by ID
GET /api/products/1
Response:
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Sample Product",
  "description": "This is a sample product",
  "price": 99.99
}
Create Product
POST /api/products
Request Body:
{
  "name": "New Product",
  "description": "New product description",
  "price": 49.99
}
Update Product:
PUT /api/products/1
Request Body:
{
  "name": "Updated Product",
  "description": "Updated description",
  "price": 59.99
}
Delete Product:
DELETE /api/products/1

Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/product-management-api.git
Configure the database in application.properties:

properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
Run the application:
mvn spring-boot:run
Test the API using tools like Postman or cURL.

Exception Handling
The API ensures meaningful error responses with clear messages. For example, if a product is not found, the API returns a 404 Not Found status with the message: "Product not found".
